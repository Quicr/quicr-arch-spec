// Should we call it realtime delivery protocol over QUIC rather than media delivery?

This specification outlines the design for a media delivery protocol over QUIC. It is based on a publish/subscribe metaphor where entities publish and subscribe to data that is sent to, and received from, relays in the cloud. The information subscribed to is named such that this forms an overlay
information centric network.

The protocol is designed to support a wide variety of realtime applications such as mdeia streaming, interactive communication and gaming.
